"""
The controllers module contains classes for performing all platform init, build, and management operations.
Right now (11/5/2018) much of the controller logic still lives in the cli/tool.py file, but over time it should
all be migrated here.

This will allow for programmatic control over builds, configuration, etc. as an alternative to using the command line.
